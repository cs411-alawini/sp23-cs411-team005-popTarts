## Project Summary
Project Summary - The project aims to create an e-commerce website that specializes in selling games. The website will have a user-friendly interface and allow customers to browse and purchase games. We want to create a database of the Steam game data, allow users to make purchases of games in the system, and allow users to search for specific games or filter by game genre, game price, or what platforms the game can be played on. Although our web application will be created to store the game data, we want to include ways to generalize the database for the storage of any product so that small business owners can create their own e-commerce site using our platform. For this purpose, the “purchases” on our web application will not actually purchase the game, but they will be reflected in our site’s inventory records. In real-world implementation, businesses would be able to actually sell the products, but as we don’t actually own the Steam games to sell, there will not be real monetary purchases in our implementation. Small businesses often have a difficult time creating an online store without spending money and relinquishing control to another company; we want to provide an open-source option that anyone can access and customize to best fit their needs. 

1. Inventory Management:
    The website will keep track of inventory levels of the games. It will automatically update the availability of games based on the stock levels. The inventory management system will also be used to keep track of sales and generate reports on the performance of different products.
2. Features:
User-friendly interface for browsing and purchasing Steam games, real-time inventory management system, option for customers to add games to their wishlist, ability to search for and filter game listings, and administrative settings for owners to customize the database. 
3. Target Audience: The website will target Steam gamers who are interested in purchasing games. It will provide a convenient and accessible platform for customers to research and purchase their favorite games. The open-source aspect of our project will target small businesses and aim to provide them with an opportunity to set up an e-commerce website for their own products.
